## How to create an object:

```javascript
- syntax: you can use either -

let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax- this is more commonly used
 ```

An object can be created with an optional list of properties. A property is a ‚Äúkey: value‚Äù pair, where the key or property name is a string and the value can be anything.

Let us take a real life example of an object, say, a siamese. The properties of the object cat can include that he has legs = 4, color = "lilac-point", eyes = "blue", ears = 2, tail: true, etc. 

The methods of our object can include things the cat can do, actions such as meow(), drink(), eat(), sleep(), etc. When an object's property is a function, it's called a method instead. 

By now you are familiar with alerts. An alert is a method of a window object.

```javascript
window.alert('For realz');
```

Because window is the top-level object in the browser you can access the properties and methods directly.  
So `alert();` is the same as `window.alert();`

*example - create an object*
```javascript
let user = {
    name: "Rafael",   
    age: 30, 
    turtle: true,
    "likes Leonardo": false  // usually leave the last comma off
    // note: the multi worded string must be quoted
};
```
---
### Dot Notation

Property values are accessible using the dot notation:

```javascript
alert( user.name ); 
// Rafael

alert( user.age ); 
// 30
```

The exception is this won't work with multi-word property names.

*Here is a multi-word property name that gives a syntax error*

`user.likes Leonardo = true`

For these cases, use square bracket notation:

```javascript
let user = {};
user["likes Leonardo"] = true;
alert(user["likes Leonardo"]);
//outputs true
```

To delete properties, write like so:

```javascript
delete user.age;
delete user["likes Leonardo"];
```

Variables are objects, too. That means they will also have properties and methods.

Our earlier variable favoriteFoods has an innate property called length.

```javascript
var favoriteFoods = "pizza";
alert(favoriteFoods.length);
// returns 5
```

It also accepts methods. Push here will add an item to your array.

```javascript
var favoriteFoods = ['artichokes', 'bananas', true];
alert(favoriteFoods);
favoriteFoods.push('pizza');
alert(favoriteFoods);
```

```javascript
var favoriteFoods = ['artichokes', 'bananas', true, 'pizza'];
alert(favoriteFoods.includes('marshamallows'));
\\ will return false
```

### Review

* We have an ‚ÄúOBJECT‚Äù.
* Objects contain ‚ÄúPROPERTIES‚Äù.  
* Properties have ‚ÄúNAME and VALUES‚Äù key pairs. 
* A value could be a method/function or other data type.
* Object methods are associated to the function in order to make it accomplish a specific task. For example console.log() or document.write() in this case .log () and .write () are built-in methods, the console and the document are objects.

#### Using Square Brackets for Computed Properties

*example - the property name is taken from the variable*

```javascript
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5, 
};
alert( bag.apple ); 
// outputs 5 if fruit = "apple"`
```

This is the same as:
```javascript
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};
bag[fruit] = 5;
```

**Exercise 4 - The window object**

What is window? You can find out by using the `typeof` method.

```javascript
console.log(typeof window);
```

Answer: window is a JavaScript object.  

To access the properties of window, you use a dot . to specify.

Try out
`alert(window.innerWidth);`

Now try out 
`alert(window.innerHeight);`

For example, window also has these properties:

- window.origin which is a string
- window.scrollY which is a number this will give you the current scroll position.
- window.location which is an object
- window.innerWidth which is a number
