## Conditionals

### The if statement
Use if to specify a block of code that will be executed if a specified condition is true.

```javascript
* syntax *

if (condition) {
   statements
}
```


```javascript
* example *

var myNum1 = 7;  
var myNum2 = 10;  
if (myNum1 < myNum2) {  
   alert("JavaScript is easy to learn.");  
}
```

```javascript
* try this out *

if (window.location.hostname != 'google.com') {
  alert('ü§ó')
}
```
---
###### CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
### The else statement


```javascript
* syntax *

if (expression) {
   // executed if condition is true
}
else {
   // executed if condition is false
}
```

```javascript
* example *

var myNum1 = 7;
var myNum2 = 10;
if (myNum1 > myNum2) {
   alert("This is my first condition");
}
else {
   alert("This is my second condition");
}
```

```javascript
* example *

var age = 25;
if (age >= 18) {
   alert("Allowed.");
}
else {
   alert("Not allowed.");
}
```

```javascript
if (window.location.hostname == 'google.com') {
  alert('Welcome to Google! ü§ó')
} else {
  alert('Please come back soon! üòâ')
}
```

```javascript
* basic *

if (userName) {
  logIn (userName);
}
 else {
   signUp ();
}
```

```javascript
* note: this can also be written like *

userName && logIn (userName) || signUp ();
```

###### CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
### The else if statement
- You can use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
- The else if statement always comes after the if statement and before the else statement. 
- You can write as many else if statements as you need.
- Statements are read from top to bottom, so the first condition that evaluates to true is the block that will get executed.

```javascript
var course = 1;
if (course == 1) {
   document.write("<h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>");
} else if (course == 2) {
   document.write("<h1>CSS Tutorial</h1>");
} else {
   document.write("<h1>JavaScript Tutorial</h1>");
}
```

```javascript
let stopLight = 'yellow';

if (stopLight === 'red') {
  console.log('Stop!');
} else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
  console.log('Slow down...');
} else if (stopLight === 'green') {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Proceed with caution!');
}
```

```javascript
* example *

var status = 1;
var msg;
if (status == 1) {
   msg = "Online";
} else if (status == 2) {
   msg = "Away";
} 
else {
   msg = "Offline";
}
```
---
###### CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
### The Switch statement

```javascript
* syntax *

switch (expression) {
  case n1:
     statements
     break;
  case n2:
     statements
     break;
  default: 
     statements
}
```

In cases where you need to test for multiple conditions, writing if else statements for each condition while valid might be laborious. For instance, we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a variable. If else statements will work fine, but if you have over 100 different values then this markup will be demanding. A switch statment provides an easier syntax. 

- The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The switch expression is evaluated once. The value of each expression is compared with the values of each case. If they match, the associated block of code is executed. 
- You can have as many case statements as needed.

A switch statement looks like this:

```javascript
let dessertPreparation = 'rice pudding';

switch (dessertPreparation) {
  case 'cookies':
    console.log('You will need an oven.');
    break;
  case 'lemon bars':
    console.log('You will need a fridge.');
    break;
  case 'rice pudding':
    console.log('You will need a stovetop.');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Check your recipe for further details.');
    break;
}
// Prints 'You will need a stovetop.'
```

1. Inside the code block, there are multiple cases. The case keyword checks if each expression matches the value that comes after it. The first value is 'cookies'. If the value of dessertPreparation equals 'cookies', then that case‚Äòs console.log would run.

2.  Here, the value of dessertPreparation is 'rice pudding', so the third case runs‚Äî 'You will need a stovetop.' will then be logged to the console.

3. The **break** keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. 

4. If there isn't a **break** keyword then the program would execute the code for all the matching cases and the default code as well. This behavior is different from if/else conditional statements which will execute only one block of code.

5. At the end of each switch statement, always include a **default** statement. If none of the cases are true, the code in the **default** statement will then run.


```javascript
* example *

var day = 2;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    document.write("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    document.write("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    document.write("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    document.write("Another day");
}
/* outputs "Tuesday" */
```
---
###### CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
#### The break Keyword

When JavaScript code reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block. Usually, a break should be put in each case statement.

*What is the output of this code?*

```javascript
var x = 3;
switch (x) {
  case 1:
    document.write(x);
    break;
  case 2:
    document.write(x+2);
    break;
  default:
    document.write(x+5);
}
```

*explanation*

- "Case 1" and "Case 2" looks like a numbering system for the cases, but it's not.
- Case 1 means "Does x match 1?" x is 3, so it doesn't match 1. So the document won't write x.
- Case 2 means "Does x match 2?" x is 3, so it doesn't match 2 So the document won't write x+2.
- The default will execute: The document will write x + 5 (3 + 5), which is 8.

---
###### CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
#### The default Keyword

The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match.

*example*

```javascript
var color ="yellow";
switch(color) { 
   case "blue":
     document.write("This is blue.");
     break;
   case "red": 
    document.write("This is red.");
     break;
   case "green": 
     document.write("This is green."); 
     break;
   case "orange": 
      document.write("This is orange."); 
      break;
   default: 
      document.write("Color not found.");
}
//outputs "Color not found."
```

### Summary on Conditional Statements

Here are some of the major concepts for conditionals:

- An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
- if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
- We can add more conditions using else if statements.
- Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
- The logical and operator, &&, or ‚Äúand‚Äù, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
- The logical operator ||, or ‚Äúor‚Äù, checks if either provided expression is truthy.
- The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
- The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
- A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.

## Loops

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. They are handy in cases in which you want to run the same code repeatedly, adding a different value each time.

JavaScript has three types of loops: for, while, and do while. 
ES6 introduces other for loop types; you can learn about them in the ES6 course later.

---
###### LOOP STATEMENTS
### The for loop

```javascript
* syntax *

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
   code block to be executed
}
```

```javascript
* example *

for (var i = 1; i<=5; i++) {  
   document.write(i + "<br />");  
}
```

- (var i = 1) is the **initial state** It sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 1) to one.
- i<=5; is a **conditional statement**. It defines the condition for the loop to run (it must be less than or equal to 5).  
- On every iteration of the loop, we check this comparison.  
- If it's true, we execute the code in the block.  
- If it's false, we exit the loop.  
- If you omit this statement, then you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise, the loop will never end.
- i++ is the **increment expresssion**. It increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.  
- Statement 3 is also optional, and it can be omitted if you increment your values inside the loop.

```javascript
var i = 0;
for (; i < 10; ) {
   document.write(i);
   i++;
}
```

```javascript
* example *

var i = 1;
for (k=1; k<10; k++){
   i += k;
   document.write(i++"<br />");
}
```
---
###### LOOP STATEMENTS
### The while loop


```javascript
* syntax *

while (condition) {   
   code block
}
```

```javascript
* example *

var i=0;
  while (i<=10) {
    document.write(i + "<br />");
    i++;
}
```
The loop will continue to run as long as i is less than, or equal to, 10. Each time the loop runs, it will increase by 1.
This will output the values from 0 to 10.

```javascript
* another example *

var x=1;
  while (x<=10) {
    document.write(x + "<br />");
    x = x + 1;
}
```
Be sure to be careful when writing conditions. If a condition is always true, the loop will run forever.

---
###### LOOP STATEMENTS
### The Do While Loop

The do...while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, and then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. 
The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested.

```javascript
* syntax *

do {
   code block
}
while (condition);
```

```javascript
* example *

var i=20;
do { document.write(i + "<br />");
  i++;  
}
while (i<=25);
//this will print out numbers from 20 to 25.
```

```javascript
* example *

var count=1;
do {
  document.write("hello <br />");
  count++;
} 
while (count<=10);
```
---
### **The Break Keyword**

The break statement "jumps out" of a loop and continues executing the code after the loop. You can use the return keyword to return some value immediately from the loop inside of a function. This will also break the loop.

```javascript
for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
   if (i == 5) {
     break;
   }
   document.write(i + "<br />");
}
```
---
###### LOOP STATEMENTS
### **The Continue Keyword**

The continue statement breaks only one iteration in the loop, and continues with the next iteration.

```javascript
for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
   if (i == 5) {
      continue; 
   }
  document.write(i + "<br />");
}
```

The value 5 is not printed, because continue skips that iteration of the loop.

---
Q.) What is the output of this code?

```javascript
var sum=0; 
for(i=4; i<8; i++) {
  if (i == 6) {
    continue; 
  }
  sum += i;
}
document.write(sum);
```

Explanation: the "loop" will loop three times according to loop condition. 
at the first loop "i" will equal "4".
at the second loop i = 5 
the third i = 7 (since the 6 is skipped with the "continue statement")
so "sum" will be iterated this way: 
1- sum = 0 + 4 = 4.
2- sum = 4 + 5 = 9.
3- sum = 9 + 7 = 16.
so sum equals 16

#### Quiz

Q.) What is the output of this code?

```javascript
var x = 0;
  while(x<6) {
  x++;
}
document.write(x);
```

Answer 6. The value is incremented AFTER the condition is checked, so in this case when x reaches 5 is true according to the condition, so it is allowed to be incremented. The loop now will stop because the condition is not true

Q.) Fill in the right keywords to test the conditions:

```javascript
_______(day_of_week) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
  case 4:
  case 5:
    document.write("Working Days");
_______;
;
  case 6:
    document.write("Saturday");
_____;
;
  default:
    document.write("Today is Sunday");
    break;
}
```

Q.) Fill in the right keywords to compose a loop:

```javascript
var i=0;
__do____{
   document.write(i);
    i++;
}
 __while____(i < 10);
```
